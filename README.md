✨🖌️ Handwritten Digit Recognition – Magic at Your Fingertips ✨

Imagine writing a digit by hand, and in an instant, an intelligent neural network recognizes it! 🚀

This Python application lets you draw digits on a simple, intuitive Tkinter canvas and sends them to a TensorFlow/Keras model trained on MNIST for instant predictions. 💡🤖

🎯 Features

🖍️ Draw & Predict – Draw a digit directly in the Tkinter canvas.

🤖 Powered by ML – Your drawing is processed by a trained MLP for fast, accurate predictions.

💾 Saved Model – The model (.h5) is ready to reuse anytime.

🎨 User-Friendly GUI – Clean interface with simple Predict and Clear buttons.
